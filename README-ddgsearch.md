# ddgsearch
## a tool for searching duckduckgo and scraping the results

ddgsearch.py is a tool for searching duckduckgo, then scraping the results for text, and returning a list of results including url, title, and text, and useful_text. useful_text is the content of the page, as plain text, with all the html and junk (ads, navigation, etc) removed.

### CLI Usage

First install python (I used v3.10). Then set up a virtual environment and install the requirements using the setupvenv script:

Windows:
```
.\setupvenv.ps1
```

Linux / Mac:
```
. ./setupvenv.sh
```

Next, copy the file 'setcreds template.py' to 'setcreds.py' and fill in your OpenAI API key. (you could put a blank string in there if you don't have an API key or don't want to use openai)

Now you can search duckduckgo and scrape the results:

```
python ddgsearch.py query [--numresults <numresults=10>] [--clean_with_llm] [--outfile <outfile name>] [--loglevel <loglevel=ERROR>] [--noprint]
```

```
query: the search query
numresults: the maximum number of results to return
clean_with_llm: if set, it will use openai's completion api to extract the useful text from the page. This is slower, but more accurate. If not set, it will use a python port of readability.js to extract the useful text from the page. This is faster, but less accurate. If you don't have an openai api key, you must not set this.
outfile: if set, it will write the results to a json file with the given name. By default it will write to './working/<query>.txt'
loglevel: the log level to use. Default is ERROR. Other options are INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, CRITICAL.
noprint: if set, it will not print the results to the console.
```

Example:
```
python ddgsearch.py "how to make a great pastrami sandwich" --numresults 2 --clean_with_llm
```

Result (note that this is the truncated output to the console; the full output is written to a file):

### Usage as a library

You can also use ddgsearch as a library. You call the ddgsearch function with the following parameters:

```
def ddgsearch(query, numresults=10, clean_with_llm=False, outfile=None, loglevel="ERROR", noprint=False):
    '''
    query: the search query
    numresults: the maximum number of results to return
    clean_with_llm: if set, it will use openai's completion api to extract the useful text from the page. This is slower, but more accurate. If not set, it will use a python port of readability.js to extract the useful text from the page. This is faster, but less accurate. If you don't have an openai api key, you must not set this.
    outfile: if set, it will write the results to a json file with the given name. By default it will write to './working/<query>.txt'
    loglevel: the log level to use. Default is ERROR. Other options are INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, CRITICAL.
    noprint: if set, it will not print the results to the console.
    '''
```

Here is an example of how to use it:

```
from ddgsearch import ddgsearch
import json

query = "how to make a great pastrami sandwich"

# search duckduckgo and scrape the results

results = ddgsearch(query, numresults=2, clean_with_llm=True)

# print the results
print (f"Results: {json.dumps(results, indent=2)}")
```

Result:

I made this on rye bread that I toasted before assembling the sandwich. The pastrami was very tender from simmering in the broth, so the meat just melted in the mouth.  I drained the pastrami before putting on the bread so that the sandwich would not be soggy.\n    \nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n                Ginny Sue\n            \n              Reply\n          \n                      4\n                  \n I moved to central Ohio in 2011.

My construction; Put 3 tbls about 1/4 to 1/3 c. sauerkraut in a small strainer and hold under hot water for 5 sec's. to heat and dilute bitter juice and smell. Squeeze in strainer till near dry. Place and spread on Pumpernickel rye, Marble rye or caraway rye bread. Add a slice of havarti or swiss (keep cheese 1/2\" from edge of bread for melt compensation), spread 1 tsp dijon or coarse mustard on kraut and cheese (substitute 1 or 2 tbls Marie's 1000 island dressing or add to the mustard). Nuke 6 oz. (8 oz. if using pan sized bread) Hillshire Farms pastrami or pre-cooked equivalent for 30 sec., steam or heat in beef broth till hot (DO NOT COOK!). Drip dry and add heated pastrami. Cover with second bread slice. Grill in frying pan. (Very lightly butter outside of top slice. Place in hot pan buttered side down. Lightly butter slice 2 outside while grilling.) Temp and time; roughly 300 F., 5 min a side. Flip if wisp of light smoke is seen and remove when side 2 reveals same smoke. I use the olfactory device in the middle of my face to monitor grilling to a little over done (smoke and light burn smell) for another added great taste variety. Cheese melt migration to bread edge is also a temp indicator to ensure kraut and meat are hot.\n    \nicons / ellipsis / ellipsis-horizontal\n\n

Pastrami on rye continued to be developed throughout New York\u2014and particularly within American Jewish communities\u2014and has since become a popular menu item for many enthusiasts of kosher meat and sandwiches lovers alike.\nMaking the sandwich on your weekly menu is far more involved than placing meat on bread. We\u2019ll be going over a detailed recipe for a killer pastrami sandwich, talking a little bit about variations on pastrami itself, and hopefully providing your guests with a great meal.\n\nImage: CC by 3.0, Erika39, via Wikipedia Commons\n\nHow to Make the Best Pastrami Sandwich at Home\n\nImage: CC by A-SA 4.0, Xisler, via Wikipedia Commons\nWhat You Need to Make a Pastrami Sandwich\nRye breadPastrami TomatoLettuceOnionCheeseButterSalt and pepper (to taste)\nHow to Make the Perfect Pastrami Sandwich\nSince there are tons of ways to build upon the simplistic nature of a pastrami sandwich, we\u2019ll be going over the basics and touch upon a few variations you can try out a little later on.\n\nImage: CC by A-SA 2.0, star5112, via Flickr\n1. Side Dishes for Your Pastrami Sandwich\nWhile it might seem counterintuitive, to start our pastrami on rye, we\u2019re going to need to get the onions going first. \nAfter slicing up enough farmer\u2019s market onions to top off the number of sandwiches you need, prepare a pan by dropping in a good amount of butter and melting over medium heat. Once we\u2019ve got a heated pan and cooked butter, drop in your onions and begin the caramelization process.\nCaramelization can take several minutes, so we\u2019re going to come back to these once they\u2019ve turned a nice golden brown.\nWhile we\u2019re waiting for those to cook, it is time to get back to the rest of our ingredients. \nUsing a cutting board, slice up your tomatoes\u2014leaving enough thickness to give a nice height and flavor to the finished sandwich. If you need to prepare your lettuce, this is also the best time to get on that. \nDon\u2019t forget to go back over and stir the onions on occasion to prevent uneven cooking.\n2. The Bread\n\nImage: CC 0 by Public Domain, anaterate, via Pixabay\nNext, we\u2019ll need to work on our bread. For the sake of tradition, consider using rye bread or a similar type\u2014but whatever you choose, make sure you use a thin (but not too thin) slice to bring out the other flavors in the sandwich. Other options to consider include sourdough and strong whole wheat bread. \nWe\u2019re going to want to get these toasted, which can be done in two ways\u2014either by utilizing your oven, or preferably coating with butter and tossing on the grill. If either option isn\u2019t possible for your kitchen, wait until after your onions have caramelized and use the empty pan to get started on toasting. \nBe sure to go easy on the butter\u2014we\u2019re going for toasted bread, not Texas Toast or garlic bread.\n3. The Meat\nIt is time to get back to the pastrami, but how you\u2019ve purchased the meat plays a major factor in how you serve your sandwich. Purchased sliced pastrami from your local deli means there is no need to cook the meat. Simply lay on the bottom slice atop your lettuce and tomato, slide the caramelized onions on top, and you\u2019re good to go.\nBringing out the smokey flavor of the pastrami requires more steps to go over.\nAdding some melted goat cheese on top and stacking your pastrami slices in the oven comes next.\u00a0 Top it up with cheese, and blast it until melted. This will give you a warmer and gooey taste and works best for those who prefer a hotter sandwich. \nGetting classy with your sandwich suggests cooking your pastrami much like your onions. Using a pan coated in olive oil add, in about half of the pastrami you\u2019re planning to use and cook for about a half-minute per side. \nDo the same for the other half and keep cooking until we get a similar caramelized appearance as we did on our onions. Once you\u2019re done, add the pastrami to the base we\u2019ve already made and salt and pepper to taste.\n4. The Pastrami Sandwich\n\nImage: CC by A 2.0, jeffreyw, via Wikipedia Commons\nChoosing to cook your pastrami, try finishing it off by giving the entire assembled sandwich time to toast on the pan. If you need to, use your spatula to press down on the bread to keep a nice, even coat. Let the sandwich press do the rest for you.\nOnce you\u2019re done, serve immediately or slice in half. For all the hard work you\u2019ve put into this sandwich, it\u2019s understandable to want to impress guests with a killer cross-section. \nFor an extra splash of tradition, offer deli mustard and make sure your pastrami is stacked too high for comfort. \nWith this dish, there\u2019s no such thing as too much meat. \nMelt butter in a pan and begin caramelizing your onions.Prepare thick slices of tomato and thin slices of toasted bread.Cook (or neglect to cook) your pastrami and assemble immediately.Toast generously on both sides, cut in half, and enjoy!.\nVariations and Meal Ideas for Pastrami Sandwich\nA sandwich as simple as pastrami on rye is practically begging for innovation\u2014and we\u2019ve got several options available to you to try and breathe new life into this old classic. We\u2019ll be going over these options, other dishes you can try to serve alongside the pastrami and rye, and a brief look into the importance of the meat itself. \nUsing\u00a0The Right Pastrami\n\nImage: CC by A 2.0, Arnold Gatilao, via Wikipedia Commons\nChoosing whether or not to use pre-sliced pastrami or cooking the pastrami yourself has a lot to do with the history of the meat and the quality that you\u2019ve purchased.\nPastrami is usually well seasoned and spiced, brined, smoked, and steamed. The Jewish roots mean that a traditional pastrami sandwich comes from the kosher beef plate. The same goes for the exhaustive nature of making pastrami. Although, in the modern-day, one opts to find easier pastrami preparation from beef brisket.\u00a0\nGoing for a traditional pastrami sandwich implies being willing to go the extra mile.\u00a0 Choosing the pastrami made from the beef plate provides a proven base from which to cook the meat yourself. However, if you want to keep things simple and easy to make, stick with pre-sliced pastrami. Once accented correctly with the right ingredients results in a great sandwich for all.\nIt all depends on what you\u2019re going for, the kind of tastes you want to bring out, and your price range. \nShaking Things Up\n\nImage: CC 0 by Public Domain, (Unidentified Author), via Max Pixel\nSide items remain an important accent for your pastrami sandwich. Remember that the limit appears not among the bare bones of a pastrami on rye.\nLike other sandwiches commonly served at delis, experimenting with various cheeses to meet certain tastes makes a better meal. Throwing\u00a0a fried egg to add a little more protein and thickness surely gives a more irresistible taste. Avocado stands as a popular choice in modern delis. This adds more green in balancing out all that red meat.\nIf you\u2019re looking to shake things up, try adding red or green peppers to bring out the natural flavors of pastrami. Deli-style neutral pasta like macaroni incorporates the full meal into a small sandwich. Whatever you choose to do, try to keep your big changes to one solid deviation. A good pastrami sandwich denotes the lack of distraction. Trying too hard usually brings out diminishing returns. \nSoups, Salads, and Side items\n\nImage: CC by A-SA 3.0, Jonathunder, via Wikipedia Commons\nAs a simple-but-filling sandwich, the pastrami on rye can be served in multiple portions to constitute a full meal.\u00a0 Pairing with other items keeps things interesting. Here are a few ways you can tie together a full meal with the pastrami on rye, without breaking the bank:\nMost summer salads pair great with pastrami! Try adding a Cobb or Mediterranean salad that gives you a bit more garden with this meat-heavy item. Tomato-based soups also work well with pastrami. Moreover, hungry guests satisfied with the dipping sauce guarantees more cravings for the meal.\nOther side items include classic options like chips or onion rings. But anyone looking to serve a pastrami sandwich that includes avocado might prefer lighter sides like coleslaw. \nIf you want to keep with the history of the sandwich, go with a kosher pickle wedge. It sounds relatively inexpensive yet works great with the sandwich. It shows a little bit of understanding of where your meal came from. \nHow Do You Like to Have Your Pastrami Sandwich?\nThe pastrami sandwich holds a great option for a simple lunch option or a quick and tasty dinner item. Traditionally cooked over a grill or purchased pre-made makes a good choice! Mastering the art of such a simple sandwich gives you another set of gourmet skills. Choosing to cook your own works out as more beneficial and rewarding than it initially appears. \nBe sure to try out the pastrami sandwich with Mediterranean meals, in conjunction with other finger foods, or for a lazy night around the house. \u00a0\n\nImage: CC by Jeremy Keith, PACAF, via Flickr\nFeatured Image: CC by 3.0, Erika39, via Wikipedia Commons.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle+\n\nPinterest\n\nEliot Martin\u00a0Eliot Martin is a book lover and a public relations graduate.

Pastrami sandwiches are quick and easy way to ease the crave for the rueben.  Mine is really easy and quick.  Lightly toast seeded Jewish rye bread and and sauce to both.  This can be anything from mustard to kicked up russian dressing.  Gently warm the pastrami  with cheese on top, just until the cheese stars to melt.  Put it together and you are done.  Of course, when I have time, I will ad sauerkraut etc,\u2026but usually for a quick fake Reuben\u2026.it is just cheese and mustard.\n\nReply \n\nSpeak Your Mind Cancel replyName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\n \n\u0394 \n As a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, this site may earn from qualifying purchases.
